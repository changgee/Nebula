Description: Functions implementing the Network-based latent-Dirichlet subtype analysis (Nebula) algorithm for variational inference using Dirichlet mixture model with incorporation of graphical knowledge. Practically, this can be used to incorporate biological networks/pathways to inform clustering solutions.
